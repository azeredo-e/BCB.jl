BCB.jl is an interface in the Julia programming language for the data API of Brazil's Central Bank (BCB).  
The project was inspired by [python-bcb](https://github.com/wilsonfreitas/python-bcb) created by wilsonfreitas@GitHub.

## Status

The project is still in its early days, a pre-alpha stage. Although some functions already work, none of them is of much value until the core of the GetCurrency module (first module being developed) is completed.
